      <h3>My Favorite Vacation Spot is Kailasakona Waterfall at India.</h3>
      <p>
        Every trip to a waterfall serves as the reminder of the
        <b>planet's</b> untamed, natural beauty and an opportunity to
        re-establish one's connection to the peace of nature. Every time we
        visit the place, it gives us a lot of <b>pasitive energy</b>.

      <h2>My Favorite food is Mutton Biriyani</h2>
      <P>
        The tastes of mutton biryani are renowned to be intense and complex. Tender mutton meat, flavorful spices, and fragrant basmati rice combine to produce a mouthwatering and fulfilling flavor profile.
        The mutton biryani is good. I like this traditional dish because of the tastes, textures, and overall dining experience that it provides.
